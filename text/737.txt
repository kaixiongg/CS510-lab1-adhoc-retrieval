scientists across uk pushing boundaries taking steps build future diabetes harm ways trying achieve goal type type type diabetes insulinproducing beta cells pancreas destroyed immune system means make insulin need live stop type diabetes need disrupt immune system attack beta cells scientists working aiming develop test treatments called immunotherapies target immune system stop destroying beta cells means future could stop people ever developing type diabetes people high risk getting type diabetes immunotherapies tested trials able delay onset condition months scientists exploring whether giving treatments earlier younger children could better success preventing type entirely immunotherapies also potential help people newly diagnosed type diabetes researchers hope able slow halt immune attack protect surviving beta cells seems might able least shortterm treatments tested far preserve amount insulin people make improve blood glucose control protective effects appear dwindle time work done look combine immunotherapies target different parts immune system greater impact find immunotherapies work research area people already living type diabetes cure likely mean combination different treatments first need replace beta cells destroyed immune system people type diabetes make enough insulin transplants using cells taken donors already exist stop working time limited number donated pancreases available scientists trying make unlimited supply beta cells lab labmade cells already implanted animals shown successfully treat type diabetes know lasting benefits recently researchers canada usa moved testing transplants people type diabetes shown transplants safe trials underway right see improve amount insulin people type diabetes make really exciting milestone still way go kind treatment could used replace insulin injections pumps funding research get us quicker dr natasha hill hoping make fully working beta cells stem cells see successfully treat type diabetes mice next need protect newly transplanted beta cells destroyed immune system one way may immunotherapies aim retrain immune system attack pancreas another potential route transplant beta cells protective barrier called beta cell encapsulation barrier would allow beta cells sense blood glucose levels let important nutrients need survive would block rogue immune cells attacking different methods beta cell encapsulation tested animals shown successfully protect cells six months handful encapsulation devices also tested trials people type diabetes showing safe shortterm researchers beginning test protect immune destruction help control blood glucose levels really encouraging fast growing area still barriers overcome scientists need test protective devices safe beneficial longer term work make treatments accessible less expensive  type diabetes body stops responding insulin beta cells stop working properly lose ability produce insulin time means make right amount insulin body needs hugely promising area research type diabetes showing remission possible remission means people normal blood glucose levels without taking diabetes medication scientists breaking new ground understanding put type diabetes remission one approach showing exciting promise weight management comes weight loss people go remission different ways recently real buzz around results direct trial testing lowcalorie diet alongside weight loss support healthcare professional end year one half people taking part trial remission cure mean different things different people put type diabetes remission may see cure important remember condition might come back need carry regular health checks remission also possible everyone condition excitingly evidence building around remission changing way think type diabetes thanks research necessarily lifelong condition everyone like type diabetes research engineer beta cells lab could lead ways replacing cells stopped working people type diabetes researchers canada recently shown combination stem cell transplants diabetes medication successfully treated mice type diabetes early trials going people type diabetes successful could pave way cell replacement therapies type diabetes well scientists exploring ways keep beta cells healthy stop type diabetes progressing research fellow professor david hodson looking one way using stateoftheart imaging technology find beta cells work together pancreas mice found pancreas starts working properly small group beta cells called hubs switched opens possibilities kick starting hubs help people make right amount insulin also supporting dr leclerc attempting work particular molecule called sorcin protect beta cells becoming exhausted keep healthy research reboot beta cells early days exciting stuff
